Chapter 1: Food - Where Does It Come From?

All living things need food to survive. Food gives us energy to play, study, and grow. But have you ever wondered where our food comes from?

1.1 Food from Plants

Many foods we eat come from plants. Different parts of plants give us different types of food:

Seeds and Grains:
- Rice comes from rice plants
- Wheat is used to make bread and roti
- Pulses like dal come from legume plants

Fruits:
- Mangoes, apples, and bananas grow on trees
- Fruits are the part of the plant that contains seeds

Vegetables:
- Roots: Carrots, radish, beetroot
- Stems: Potato (underground stem), ginger
- Leaves: Spinach, cabbage, lettuce
- Flowers: Cauliflower, broccoli

1.2 Food from Animals

We also get food from animals:

Milk and Dairy:
- Cows and buffaloes give us milk
- Milk is used to make butter, cheese, and yogurt

Eggs:
- Chickens lay eggs
- Eggs are rich in protein

Meat:
- Some people eat chicken, fish, and mutton
- These provide protein to our body

Honey:
- Bees make honey from flower nectar
- Honey is sweet and nutritious

1.3 Food Chain

Plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air. This process is called photosynthesis. Animals cannot make their own food, so they depend on plants or other animals.

Simple Food Chain:
Grass → Goat → Human

The grass makes its own food, the goat eats grass, and humans may eat goat meat or drink goat milk.

Activity:

1. Make a list of 5 foods you ate today
2. For each food, identify if it came from a plant or animal
3. Draw a simple food chain showing how energy moves from plants to animals

Remember: We should be thankful for our food and never waste it!
